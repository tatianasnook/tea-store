## Description
The Online Tea Store website is a React project designed to facilitate online sales of tea blends for the Tea Land company. Upon opening the app, users are directed to the Home page, featuring a variety of teas sold by Tea Land. Users can filter teas by type, including green, black, herbal, white, or view all teas. Additionally, users can select individual teas to view detailed information and prices, with the option to add items to their cart if they decide to make a purchase.

Every page of the website includes a header with the Tea Land logo and three links to the Home page, About page, and Contact Us page. The About page provides insights into the company's history, accompanied by a list of advantages such as premium quality and a diverse selection of tea.

The Contact Us page notifies customers that Tea Land not only sells tea online but also has three physical stores that customers can visit.
